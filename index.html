  <p>Abuja is the capital city of Nigeria, officially becoming the capital on December 12, 1991, replacing Lagos. It was chosen for its central location, making it more accessible from all parts of the country. The city is known for its modern architecture, well-planned layout, and notable landmarks such as Aso Rock, a significant rock formation; the Nigerian National Mosque, an important site for Muslims; the Nigerian National Christian Centre, a prominent church; the Abuja National Stadium, a multi-purpose venue for sports and concerts; and Millennium Park, the city's largest public park. Additionally, Abuja hosts many government buildings, foreign embassies, and international organizations, establishing it as a crucial administrative and diplomatic hub.</p>
